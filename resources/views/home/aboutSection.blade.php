                    The Orphanage Management System was developed to make adoption of children
                    from age 0 to 2 years. We noticed adopting babies could be tricky so we
                    wanted to make the process easier. This system will super organized tool
                    that keep records of all orphans and helps make adoption smoother. In
                    emergency like, when there are flood, child is missing, in kidnapping
                    case, or children who are effected due to earthquake and many more reasons
                    our system steps in to help find and rescue them. We use modern technology
                    for people to online donate money, securely, making easy for anyone to support our NGO.
                    And we were not working alone we have built a system that lets other NGO join in and
                    share information about orphans. Itâ€™s all about using technology to make sure orphans are safe,
                    happy and find loving families.
